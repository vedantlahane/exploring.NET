# PRACTICAL ASSIGNMENT: ARRAYS & COLLECTIONS IN C#

## PROBLEM STATEMENT: Enterprise Data Processing & Control System

An enterprise system processes products, branch sales, customer transactions, financial records, task flows, and legacy data. You are required to simulate this system using C# arrays and collections, handling dynamic input, data validation, and cross-dependency between data structures.

## GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY)

1. Use only arrays and collections covered in syllabus.
2. **Do NOT use LINQ.**
3. **Do NOT create additional classes.**
4. Use runtime input for all data.
5. Perform validation where specified.
6. Output must be clearly labeled.
7. Do not hard-code values.
8. Program must execute without runtime errors.

## TASK 1 – DYNAMIC PRODUCT PRICE ANALYSIS (ARRAYS)

### WHAT THE STUDENT MUST DO

1. Ask the user to enter the number of products.
2. Create an integer array of that size.
3. Accept only positive prices for each product.
4. Calculate the average price.
5. Sort the array using `System.Array.Sort()`.
6. Replace prices below average with 0.
7. Resize the array by adding 5 new positions.
8. Fill the newly added positions with the average price.
9. Display the final array with index positions.

### EXPECTED OUTCOME

- Array is dynamically created.
- Prices below average are clearly marked as 0.
- Array size increases correctly.
- Final array reflects sorting, replacement, and resizing.

## TASK 2 – BRANCH SALES ANALYSIS (MULTI-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY)

### WHAT THE STUDENT MUST DO

1. Ask the user to enter:
   - Number of branches
   - Number of months
2. Create a 2D integer array accordingly.
3. Accept sales data for each branch and month.
4. Calculate:
   - Total sales per branch
   - Highest monthly sale across all branches
5. Display branch totals and global highest sale.

### EXPECTED OUTCOME

- Correct 2D array creation.
- Accurate per-branch totals.
- Correct identification of highest sale value.

## TASK 3 – PERFORMANCE-BASED DATA EXTRACTION (JAGGED ARRAY)

### WHAT THE STUDENT MUST DO

1. Create a jagged array derived from the 2D sales array.
2. For each branch:
   - Include only sales values greater than or equal to product average (from Task 1).
3. Dynamically allocate each jagged row based on qualifying values.
4. Display jagged array contents branch-wise.

### EXPECTED OUTCOME

- Jagged array sizes differ per branch.
- Only qualifying values appear.
- Demonstrates dependency between unrelated data structures.

## TASK 4 – CUSTOMER TRANSACTION CLEANING (LIST & HASHSET)

### WHAT THE STUDENT MUST DO

1. Ask for number of customer transactions.
2. Store customer IDs in a `List<int>` (duplicates allowed).
3. Convert the list into a `HashSet<int>` to remove duplicates.
4. Convert the HashSet back into a List.
5. Display:
   - Cleaned customer list
   - Number of duplicate entries removed

### EXPECTED OUTCOME

- Duplicate customer IDs are removed.
- Original and cleaned data counts are correctly compared.
- Demonstrates round-trip conversion.

## TASK 5 – FINANCIAL TRANSACTION FILTERING (DICTIONARY & SORTEDLIST)

### WHAT THE STUDENT MUST DO

1. Ask for number of transactions.
2. Store transaction ID and amount in a `Dictionary<int, double>`.
3. Prevent duplicate transaction IDs.
4. Create a `SortedList<int, double>` containing only transactions:
   - Amount ≥ product average (from Task 1)
5. Display sorted high-value transactions.

### EXPECTED OUTCOME

- Dictionary enforces unique keys.
- SortedList displays data in ascending key order.
- Cross-task filtering logic is applied correctly.

## TASK 6 – PROCESS FLOW MANAGEMENT (STACK & QUEUE)

### WHAT THE STUDENT MUST DO

1. Ask for number of operations.
2. Insert each operation into:
   - Queue (processing order)
   - Stack (undo tracking)
3. Process all queue elements in FIFO order.
4. Undo the last two operations using Stack.
5. Display processed and undone operations.

### EXPECTED OUTCOME

- Queue processes tasks in correct order.
- Stack correctly reverses operations.
- Proper use of LIFO and FIFO behavior.

## TASK 7 – LEGACY DATA RISK DEMONSTRATION (HASHTABLE & ARRAYLIST)

### WHAT THE STUDENT MUST DO

1. Ask for number of users.
2. Store username-role pairs in a Hashtable.
3. Store the same data in an ArrayList in mixed form.
4. Display both collections.
5. Demonstrate why mixed-type storage is risky.

### EXPECTED OUTCOME

- Hashtable displays key-value mapping.
- ArrayList contains mixed data types.
- Student shows understanding of legacy collection risks.

## FINAL EXPECTATION FROM STUDENT

By completing all tasks, the student must demonstrate:

- Mastery of arrays and collections
- Runtime data handling
- Data dependency management
- Performance-aware design
- Correct selection of data structures
- Industry-level problem solving
